\aboutme{Originally from Kansas, Michael has lived in eight states and two countries. Michael enjoys climbing, running trails then napping,  howling with his guitar, and anything else he can do outdoors. He's been coding for about five years now, but he's been exploring since the day he could walk -- perhaps even earlier.

\section{other information}
Michael used to work in construction and property management. He's found some odd overlap between his previous career and his current one, mostly in visualizing interdepent systems and the value of elbow grease (not to mention the horror of opening up someone else's beloved home to find that the whole thing is tied together with (more or less) strings). He'd love to find a home where he can continue to grow and be challenged by exciting new projects on a regular basis.
